Arbitration can be binding ornon binding. The arbitration process is akin to thelitigation process in its procedure. Arbitration is usedin commercial disputes.\nMed-Arb. Med-Arb is a hybrid ADR process. Initially,\nthe parties begin with mediation and when they areunable to reach to a negotiated settlement then it isconverted to arbitration. Med-Arb is used in disputeswhere the parties need a guarantee of finality, but theywish to attempt to negotiate an agreement.\nJudicial Settlement Conferences : The referral courts\ndesignate one or more judges to preside over settlementconferences with parties and their advocates. JudicialSettlement is generally brief process wherein a judgediscusses the prospects for settlement in a meeting withthe parties and their advocates. Section 89 of the CPCalso provides for judicial settlements. It can be voluntaryor mandatory.\nSettlement Panels :  Courts will often use settlement\npanels consisting of a judge and two Advocates, Oneplaintiff advocate and the other defense advocate toresolve disputes. It is utilizing the volunteer servicesof experienced advocates along with judges. It isbasically a negotiation process and is used in pendingCourt cases.",

The partiesexchange information and make oral representations andstatements to the evaluator. Neutral evaluation can bebinding or non-binding. It is usually done in casesinvolving technical and scientific issues.\nSpecial Master :  It is an adjudicative process, in which\nusually an advocate or a retired judge designated bya court acts as a special master. He presides over pre-trial and/or trial issues. It is used in cases of intellectualproperty, environment, construction defects which requirea high degree of expertise or where there are numerousparties. The special master in some cases preside as thetrial judge.\nNeutral Fact Finding :  Neutral fact finding is an\ninvestigation process. It can be used to investigateemployment disputes such as harassment, discriminationor wrongful termination. The process can be advisory.This ADR process is used by companies, governmentagencies and other organizations when an internalinvestigation of a complaint is not feasible.\nLitigants have a range of ADR methods to select an\nappropriate mode for redressal of their disputes. Thedisputants reserve their right to adhere to litigationwhile choosing the ADR method which is non-binding.People are to be extensively educated about ADRmechanism so that they may benefit and chooseappropriate method for resolution of their disputes.",

  "172Mediation Training Hand BookMediation Training Hand BookMediation Training Hand BookMediation Training Hand BookMediation Training Hand Book\nTraining of Mediators and Referral Judges\nPresentation by Niranjan Bhatt at the conference in Delhi\nArranged by Supreme Court mediation and conciliation committee 10.07.2010\nMediation, Conciliaiton and Arbitration are historically more ancient\nthan Anglo-Saxon adversarial system of law.  Mediaiton was very popular\namongst businessmen during pre-British rule in India. The Mahajans - theimpartial and respected businessmen used to resolve disputes betwenmembers of the business associations by the end of the day. This informalprocedure, once in vogue in the western province of India, was acombination of mediation and arbitration, now known in the western world\nas med-arb. This type of mediation had no legal sanction inspite of its\ncommon acceptance in the business world.\nThe introduction of ADR mechanisms in the Code of Civil Procedure,\n1908 is a radical step taken in recent times by Indian legislature by enactingSection 89 and Order X Rules 1A, 1B and 1C providing for ADRmachinery even in cases pending before the civil courts and has further\nauthorized the High courts to frame rules for the purpose. Thus, now the\nIndian legislature has made sufficient provisions in law to facilitateintroduction of court annexed medation.\nThe introduction of ADR mechanisms in the Indian  justice system\nhas raised great expectations and hopes in the minds of the litigants fora more satisfactory, acceptable and early resolution of their disputes.\nSkeptics out with their sharp tongued criticism pose a challenge to the\nvisionaries by raising questions. “Do we have the know how, wherewithaland the will to implement the law reforms systematically and in rightearnest ?” As stated above, legislative foresight in introducting ADRprocedures and vesting ample power in the judicial administration to carryout the reforms, are now required to be supported by a strong will and\nadministrative ability to provide for a redressing machinery to utilize ADR\nprocedures with advantage.\nTill court annexed mediation services are made available, how\nmediation reference can be effectively made by the courts ? The courtsmay have to depend upon private mediators or non-governmentalorganizations providing mediation services, if at all available. However,\ntill mediation is popularized in the country as an dispute resolution\nmechanism, litigants will be slow to accept private mediators. Thequestions are where and to whom the court will refer the cases for",
  "173Mediation Training Hand BookMediation Training Hand BookMediation Training Hand BookMediation Training Hand BookMediation Training Hand Book\nmediation ? Are there persons equipped, trained or experienced enough\nto handle complex civil and commercial disputes ? How the courts will\nbe able to monitor the cases sent to mediation ? If appropriate machineryfor providing mediation services is not made available, the moot questionthe administration will have to answer is - Are the ADR provisionsintroduced in legislation to remain in the statue books ?\nIn COURT ANNEXED MEDIATION  the mediaiton services are\nprovided by the court as a part and parcel of the same judicial system\nas against COURT REFERRED MEDIATION, wherein the court merelyreferes the matter to a mediator. The advantage of court annexed mediationis that the judges, lawyers and litigants become participants therein, therebygiving to them a feeling that negotiated settlement is achieved by all thethree actors in justice delivery system. When a judge refers a case to the\ncourt annexed mediation service, keeping overall supervision on the\nprocess, no one would feel that the system parts with the case. The judgewould feel that he refer the case to a mediator within the system. Thesame lawyers who appear in a case retain their briefs and continue torepresent their clients before the mediators within the same set-up. Thelitigants feel that they are given an opportunity to play their own\nparticipatory role in the resolution of disputes. This will also give a larger\npublic acceptance for the process as the same time tested court system,which has acquired public confidence because of integrity and impartiality,retains its control and provides an additional service. The court is theparental institution for resolution of disputes and if ADR models aredirected under court’s supervision, at least in those cases which are referred\nthrough courts, the effort of dispensing justice can become more coordinated.\nADR services under the control, guidance and supervision of the courtwould have more authenticity and smooth acceptance. It would ensure thefeeling that mediation is complimentary and not competitive with the courtsystem. The system will get a positive and willing support from the judgeswho will accept mediators as an integral part of the system. If reference\nto mediaiton is made by the judge to the court annexed mediation services,\nthe mediation process will become more expeditious and harmonized. Itwill also facilitate the movement of the case between the court and themediator faster and purposeful. Again, it will facilitate reference of someissues to mediation leaving others for trial in appropriate cases. Courtannexed mediation will give a feeling that court’s own interest in reducing\nits caseload to manageable level is furthered by mediation and therefore",
  "174Mediation Training Hand BookMediation Training Hand BookMediation Training Hand BookMediation Training Hand BookMediation Training Hand Book\nrefrence to mediation will be a willing reference. Court annexed mediation\nwill thus provide additional tool by the same system providing continuity\nto the process, and above all, court will remain a central institution forthe system. This will also establish a public-private partnership betweenthe court and the community. A popoular feeling that court works hand-in-hand with mediation facility will produce satisfactory and fastersettlements. The concept of the mediaiton, as a part of judicial system\nis comparatively a new idea recently introduced in India. The introduction\nof Court annexed mediation may look difficult in this vast country.However, for a country which provided large priority funds for establishingfast track courts for expeditious disposal of criminal cases in the recentpast, it is not impossible to make budgetary provisions for a beneficialcause, which, in the long run, can solve one of the naughtiest problems\nof a fast developing country. If court annexed mediation programme can\nbe implemented with a determination, it will enable the country to carryout a major legislative intent and provide to the nation a stimulant forthe growth of its commerce, industry and global interests. It will providea new and fresh solution to the ailing problem of delays in the court.The present dealy in disposal of the cases is mounting in a geometrical\npropotion and likely to create a crisis of confidence and therefore, it\nrequires a resolute determination and strong will to introduce the courtannexed mediation in the Indian legal system at the beginning of twenty-first century. The task is not easy but not impossible. The appointmentof an administrator for the court annexed mediation, knowledgeable andconversant with the mediation process has proved very helpful in California\nin USA. Such administrator would be able to assist the courts in\nimplementation of the programme including evaluation and monitoringthereof. He has to be provided with a minimum skeleton staff andinfrastructural facilities initially. His duties may include preparation of apanel of mediators having the knowledge, experience and mind set to workas mediators. It would be necessary to organize training programmes for\nsuch mediators as a first step. The experience in USA suggests that a 42\nhour training programme would be ideally necessary. Literature onmediation, including mediation journals published all around the worldwhere mediation has become part of the system can be subscribed whichcan help in speeding and spreading the education. A continuing educationprogramme for a lawyers, judges and even litigants as a part of the pilot\nprogramme can be very effctive. The World Bank Group for Legal and",
  "175Mediation Training Hand BookMediation Training Hand BookMediation Training Hand BookMediation Training Hand BookMediation Training Hand Book\nJudicial Reforms can be requested to provide international knowledge,\nexperience and training in the subject. As observed by World Bank’s law\nreform group, “Legal training ensures that legal and judicial reformscontribute to changing the attitudes and behaviours of lawyers and citizens.For this reason, legal training should be an integral part of the legal andjudicial reform strategies that are anchored on the rule of law and reflecta country’s societal values. Legal education strengthens professionalism,\nbuilds public confidence and facilitates consensus and momentum for\nfurther reforms. The legal education also, improves the performance oflegal professionals, enhances service quality and stimulates public respect.As a result the training programmes should be designed not only to enhanceperformance but also to instill the values of the impartiality, professionalism,competency, efficiency and public services.” Mediators should not use\ncoercive, authoritative and intimidating techniques that are used by\nuntrained mediators. Some judges use authoritative influence in judicialsettelements, and it is therefore opined in some quarters that judges donot make good mediators. However, in India there could be more publicacceptance of retired judges acting as mediators because of their multipleyears of judicial experience. If such retired  judges can be invited to be\non the panel of the court annexed mediators in India with minimum basic\ntraining to change their mind set for their intended role of mediators, theirservices can be utilized with advantage. In the words of Hon’ble BenjaminF. Overton, a retired Chief Justice of Florida Supreme Court, “Judges arethe most experienced neutrals in the justice system and should be excellentmediators but they need to fully understand the process and know when\nto bite their tongue and eliminate their authoritative face”.",

  "131. INTRODUCTION\nMediation, as a mode of alternative dispute resolution has a long\nhistory in the diplomatic arena.As pointed out by Hon’ble Chief\nJustice of India, N V Ramana, our ancient epic Mahabharata, is\nbest example of an early attempt at mediation as a conﬂict resolution\ntool, where Lord Krishna attempted to mediate the dispute between\nthe Pandavas and Kaurav as. Also it is the best example of  how\nthe failure of mediation may lead to disastrous consequen ces\ntaking lot of time.\nIn the Modern days, due to rapid increase in the commercial disputes,\nthe interest in the mediation has increased sharply. The increased\ninterest towards mediations is directly attributable to dissatisfaction\nwith the cost, time consumed and lengthy & complicated procedures\nadopted in the traditional dispute resolution systems. This has made\npeople & business entities to focus and consider the advantages of\nmediation, particularly its simple and easy procedure that oﬀers parties\nfull control over both the process of resolution and the outcom e of\nthe process.\nSince mediation is amicable settlement of the disputes, using\nmediation to settle the disputes  has been proved very satisfactory\nbecause of very high rates of success. Parties’ themselves deciding\nthe outcome of the dispute is a notable feature of the mediation. An\nachieved result acceptable to both the parties of the dispute, gives\nno scope for further litigation on the decided subject unless there is",
  "serious violation in the procedure adopted for the mediation.\nConsidering it’s time & cost advantage and unstructured procedure,\nmediation has been recently introduced for resolving the consumer\ndisputes to provide win-win situation to the consumer & business\nentities. However, still there is scope for creating awareness among\nthe consumers & business entities to popularise mediation and make\nthem use the mediation as aneﬀective tool of ADR. This document\nseeks to create awareness among the consumers, business entities,\nacademicians, students, consumer right activists and common people\nwho are interested to know how mediation works in settlement of\nconsumer disputes.\n14",
  "2. THE CONCEPT OF MEDIATION\nThe Mediation is a not a new concept in the ﬁeld of  law. Mediation\nas a method of dispute resolution can be traced to the ancient times\nas well. Also, in pre-British India, mediation was popular among\nbusinessmen. Impartial and respected businessmen called\nMahajans were requested by business association members to\nresolve disputes using an informal procedure, which combined\nmediation and arbitration. In the modern days, mediation is known\nbut least practised method of alternative disputes resolution due to\nlack of awareness. Developments in the medieval and the modern\nperiod led to growth of written laws which deﬁned the rights of\nindividuals very well. With the passage of time, to claim the rights,\nthe written laws were adopted by the individuals as tools for\ndispute resolution. These written laws proved to be tools for\nadversarial remedies for the parties, which again made a way for\nnon-adversarial methods. Considering the same, need for\nrecognition of mediation was felt by the legislature, which was\nperformed by it through incorporation of the mediation in various\nlaws and the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 is one such example.\n2.1. Deﬁnitions of term s:\n2.1.1 Dispute\nDispute means disagreement or holding opposite views between\ntwo or more persons on any point.\n15",
  "According to legal dictionary, dispute is a conﬂict or controversy;\na conﬂict of claims or rights; an assertion of a right, claim, or demand\non one side, met by contrary claims or allegations on the other.\n2.1.2 Disputed parties\nParties claiming diﬀerent interests or rights and holding opposite\nviews in dispute are referred as disputed parties.\n2.1.3 Negotiat ion\nDictionary meaning of the term ‘Negotiate’ is to bargain for\nsomething to agree at some point. Negotiation is a process where\ntwo or more parties having conﬂicting interests in any dispute bargain\namong themselves to reach a settlement where they can both agree\non. Nego tiations are made by the parties through discussions\nbetween themselves or their representatives without an involvement\nof the third party.\n2.1.4 Mediation\nThe term mediation can be deﬁned as a voluntary dispute resolution\nprocess where the third party facilitates negotiation between the\ndisputed parties to negotiate for their rights and interests by\nthemselves. The third party who facilitates the negotiation between\nthe disputed parties is called mediator.\nAs described by the Mediation and Conciliation Project\nCommittee of Supreme Court of India, ‘Mediation’ is a\nvoluntary, binding process in which an impartial and neutral\nmediator facilitates disputi ng parties in reaching a settlement. A\nmediator does not impose a solution but creates a conducive\nenvironment in which disputing parties can resolve all their disputes.\n16",
  "Mediation is tried and tested alternative method of dispute\nresolution.\n2.1.5 Mediator\nMediator is a neutral and impartial perso n who carries out the\nprocess of mediation between the disputed parties. In fact, he\nfacilitates the negotiation between the parties by acting as platform\nfor negotiation.\n2.2. Types of Med iatio n\n2.2.1Cour t- Referred Mediation\nCourt referred mediation is one where a case has been ﬁled before\nthe Court and Court refers such matter for mediation under Sec.\n89 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Court referred mediation\nis post litigation mediation. As in case of Consumer protection Act\n2019,  wherein Section 37, 49 & 59 empowers the Consumer\nCommissions to refer the Cases to the Mediation Cell Attached\nto it.\n2.2.2Private Mediation\nThe private mediation is one where qualiﬁed mediators oﬀer the\nservices of mediation on a private, fee-for-service basis to the\nCourt, to members of the public, to members of the commercial\nsector and also to the governmental sector to resolve disputes\nthrough mediation. Private mediation can be used in connection with\ndisputes pending in Court and pre-litigation disputes.The list of\nrecognised private mediation institute can be accessed at this web\nlink: http://www.ciac.in/download/GOI_ODR.pdf.\n17",
  "3. ADVANTAGES OF MEDIATION\n3.1. Voluntary Process\nMediation is a voluntary process and parties are at liberty to opt\nout of the mediation process at any stage if they don’t ﬁnd it useful.\n‘Voluntary Nature’ is essence of mediation, where parties are not\ncompelled to go through it, which ensures compliance with the\nsettlement reached.\n3.2. Control of the parties\nIn mediation, during the entire process, parties have full control over\nthe scope and outcome of the mediation. Parties themselves decide\nthe scope of reference or issues of dispute subjected for mediation\nand also the outcome of the mediation process i.e to settle or not\nand also terms of settlement.\n3.3. Active particip ation of parties\nUnlike other dispute resolution methods, mediation provides the\nparties an opportunity to actively participate in the mediation\nproceedings and to negotiate directly. Mediation facilitates parties\nto present their caseby their own.\n3.4. Cost and time eﬃcient\nDue to absence of strict and rigid procedure, the mediation is time\neﬃcient and cost eﬃcient method of dispute resolution. Fees of\n18",
  "professionals and other expenses in mediation will be very less\ncompared to traditional methods of dispute resolution.\n3.5. Convenient to the parties\nSimple and ﬂexible procedure makes the mediation convenient to\nthe parties. There will be no ﬁxed/conditional adjournments in the\nmediation. Hearing can be modiﬁed to suit the demands of each\ncase, which allows the parties to carry on with their day-to-day\nactivities.\n3.6. Ensures fair process\nThe mediator chosen will be impartial, neutral and independent. The\nlaws ensure that the mediator doesn’t have pre-existing relationship/\ninterest of any kind with the parties or subject matter. If any\nsuspicion arises on impartiality of the mediator, the parties have\noption to change the mediator.\n3.7. Conﬁdentiality\nMediation process is much more conﬁdential than conventional\nmethods of dispute resolution. The name and facts of the cases\nwhich are resolved through adjudicating bodies are easily accessible\nto everyone, since they enter public dom ain and hence there will\nbe threat to conﬁdentiality. Especially in consumer disputes,\nconsumers and sellers (including E-commerce companies) are more\nconcerned about the privacy and conﬁdentiality. In case of matters\nsettling through mediation, laws ensure conﬁdentiality of the\nproceedings.\n3.8. Amicable settlement of disputes\nMediation provides amicable settlement of the disputes which in\nturn helps to maintain, improve and restore relationships of the\ndisputed parties.\n19",
  "3.9. Final settlement of all the disputes in full/\ncomprehens ive\nIn respect of the matters/issues which are referred for Mediation,\nat each stage of the dispute resolution process,long term and\nunderlying interests of the parties are taken into account. While in\nexamining alternatives, in generating and evaluating options and\nﬁnally in settling the dispute main focus will be on the present and\nthe future and not on the past. This provides an opportunity to the\nparties to comprehensively resolve all their diﬀerences. Further,\nthere can be no appeal  against the things settled through the\nmediation which leaves no scope for further disputes but ensures\nfull, ﬁnal and comprehensive settlement of the dispute.\n3.10.Win-win deal for the disputed parties-more\nchances of compliance\nMediation provides win-win situation for the disputed parties, since\nthe parties to the dispute enter in to mutually beneﬁcial settlement\nby themselves. When the parties themselves sign the terms of\nsettlement, satisfying their underlying needs and interests, there will\nbe compliance.\n3.11. Refund of court fees\nRules made under various laws provide for the refund of the\n‘Court Fees’in the case of settlement of dispute in court referred\nmediation.\n20",
  "4. ROLE OF MEDIATORS\nMediation is an informal and non-adversarial method of dispute\nresolution intended to assist the disputing parties to reach a mutually\nacceptable solution. The role of the mediator is facilitative rather\nthan suggestive in any mediation proceeding. Mediator being an\nimpartial and neutral third person facilitates the resolution of a\ndispute without suggesting what should be the solution. The mediator\nhas greater role to play in mediation proceedings, he facilitates\nproper communication between the parties, removes obstacles\nin communication, assists in the identiﬁcation of issues and the\nexploration of options and facilitates mutually acceptable agreements\nto resolve the dispute. He performs all these functions without\nviolating the ‘right of self-determination’ of the parties.\nThe role of the mediator on basis of his functions can be classiﬁed\nin to two heads\n(i)Facilitative role to facilitate the process of mediation\n(ii)Evaluative role to assist parties to evaluate the case to\narrive at a settlement\n(i) Facilitative Role where a mediator facilitates the process of\nmediation involves the following activities\n·Creating a conducive environment for the mediation\nprocess.\n21Mediation is an informal and non-adversarial method of dispute \nresolution intended to assist the disputing parties to reach a \nmutually acceptable solution.

  "5. MEDIATION AS DISTINGUISHED\nFROM CONCILIATION AND\nADJUDICATION\n5.1. Mediation and Conciliation\nThe term conciliation is not deﬁned in the Arbitration and Conciliation\nAct, 1996.  The process of mediation is a third party facilitated\nnegotiation, whereas conciliation is a process similar to mediation\nwhere the third party has suggestive role in the process. Both the\nprocesses are voluntary and conﬁdential facilitated by a neutral third\nperson to help the parties to reach a negotiated settlement. However\nin conciliation, third person has got greater power such as\nsuggestion as to terms of a possible settlement and making\nproposals for settlement. The diﬀerence between the mediation and\nconciliation can be better understood by going through the role of\nthird parties (i.e mediator and the conciliator) in the respective\nprocesses.\nIn mediation the Mediator assists the negotiation between the\nparties. His assistance is facilitative in nature rather than suggestive.\nThe role of the mediator is minimum in respect of the procedure\nand outcome of the resolution process. On the other hand the\npowe rs of the Conciliator are larger as he can suggest propos als\nfor settlement. The diﬀerence lies in the fact that the ‘conciliator’\ncan make proposals for settlement, ‘formulate’ or ‘reformulate’ the\nterms of a possible settlement while a ‘mediator’ would not do so\nbut would merely facilitate a settlement betwee n the parties.\n23",
  "The evaluative role of mediator is limited to the function of helping\nand guiding the parties to evaluate their case through reality testing\nand assisting the parties to evaluate the options for settlement. But\nin the process of conciliation, the conciliator himself can evaluate\nthe cases of the parties and the options for settlement for the\npurpose of sugge sting the terms of settlement. The role of a\nmediator is not to give judgm ent on the merits of the case or to\ngive advice to the parties or to suggest solutions to the parties.\n5.2. Med iatio n and Adjudicatio n\nAs discussed earlier, mediation is a voluntary process where a\nneutral and impartial third party facilitates the negotiation between\nthe disputed parties. Mediation is an alternative, informal method\nof dispute resolution. On the other hand ‘adjudication’ is\nconventional method of dispute resolution adhering to the ﬁxed\nprocedure established by the law. Adjudicator generally called\nJudge/Presiding oﬃcer adjudicates the dispute between the parties\nin the process of adjudication.\nMediator is not an adjudicator since his powers are very narrow\ncompared to the powers of the adjudicator. Adjudicators like\njudges , arbitrators and presiding oﬃcers of tribunals make the\ndecision on the basis of pleadings and evidence. The adjudicator\nfollows the formal and strict rules of substantive and procedural\nlaws. The decision of the adjudicator is binding on the parties. Also\nthe decision of the adjudicator can be challenged before the higher/\nappellate bodies through an appeal or revision.\nIn adjudication, the decision is taken by the adjudicator alone and\nthe parties have no role in it. In mediation the mediator is only a\nfacilitator and he does not sugges t or make any decision. The\n24",
  "decision is taken by the parties themselves. The settlement\nagreement reached in mediation is binding on the parties. In court\nreferred mediation there cannot be any appeal, or revision against\nthe decree passed on the basis of such settlement agreement. In\nprivate mediation, the parties can agree to treat such settlement\nagreement as a conciliation agreement which then will be governed\nby the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Also\nthe mediation has got various costs and time advantages which are\ndiscussed in the later chapter of this hand book.\n5.3.

  "6. JUDICIAL APPROA CH ON\nPROMOTING MEDIATION\nAlways the judicial approach has been towards promoting the\nmediation as a mode of alternative dispute resolution. The Hon’ble\nSupr eme Court and the High courts have on many occasions\nemphasised the need to resort to mediation in respect of matters\nﬁt for mediation. The Hon’ble Supreme Court and the High courts\nhave highlighted mediation as one of the prominent non-adversarial\nmethods of alternative dispute resolution. Through various\njudgments of Supreme Court and High Courts the necessity of the\nmediation in Indian scenario can be analysed. Some of the\nimportant judgements and orders of The Hon’ble Supreme Court\nand the High courts are discussed below.\n6.1. “Mediation” is also a well-known term – It is a dispute\nresolution with the assistance of a neut ral third party who\ntries to help the disput ing parties to arrive at a negotiated\nsettlement.\nAFCONS INFRASTRUCTURE LIMITED AND\nANOT HER v. CHERIAN VARKEY CONSTR UCTION\nCOM PANY  (PRIVATE) LIMITED AND OTHERS, 2010\n(8) SCC 24.\nFacts:\nThe Cochin Port Trust, the second respondent entrusted the work\nof construction of certain bridges and roads to the appellants under\n28",
  "an agreem ent dated 20.4.2001. The appellants sub-contracted a\npart of the said work to the ﬁrst respondent under an agreement\ndated 1.8.2001. It is not in dispute that the agreement between\nthe appellants and the ﬁrst respondent did not contain any provision\nfor reference of the disputes to arbitration. The ﬁrst respondent ﬁled\na suit against the appellants for recovery of  Rs. 2,10,70,881/- from\nthe appe llants and their assets and/or the amounts due to the\nappellants from the employer, with interest at 18% per annum. In\nthe said suit an order of attachment was made on 15.9.2004 in\nregard to a sum of  Rs. 2.25 crores. Thereafter in March 2005,\nthe ﬁrst respondent ﬁled an application u/s. 89 of the Code before\nthe trial court praying that the court may formulate the terms of\nsettlement and refer the matter to arbitration. The appellants ﬁled\na counter dated 24.10.2005 to the application submitting that they\nwere not agreeable for referring the matter to arbitration or any\nof the other ADR processes u/s. 89 of the CPC. Trial court allowed\nsaid application. It recorded the fact that ﬁrst respondent (plaintiﬀ)\nwas agreeable for arbitration and appellants (defendants 1 and 2)\nwere not agreeable for arbitration. The trial court allowed the said\napplication u/s. 89 by a reasoned order dated 26.10.2005 and held\nthat as the claim of the plaintiﬀ in the suit related to a work contract,\nit was appropriate that the dispute should be settled by arbitration.\nIt formulated sixteen issues and referred the matter to arbitration.\nThe appellants ﬁled a revision against the order of the trial court.\nThe High Court by the impugned order dated 11.10.2006 dismissed\nthe revision petition holding that the apparent tenor of s. 89 of the\nCode perm itted the court, in appropriate cases, to refer even\nunwilling parties to arbitration. Hence, the present appe al was\nﬁled.\n29",
  "Issues:\n(i) What is the procedure to be followed by a court in\nimplementing Section 89 and Orde r 10 Rule 1A of the\nCPC?\n(ii) Whether consent of all parties to the suit is necessary for\nreference to arbitration u/s. 89 of the CPC ?”\nDecision:\nHeld, the court should ﬁrst ascertain whether the parties are willing\nfor arbitration. The court should inform the parties that arbitration\nis an adjudicatory process by a chosen private forum and reference\nto arbitration will permanently take the suit outside the ambit of the\ncourt. Only if both parties agree for arbitration, and also agree upon\nthe arbitrator, the matter should be referred to arbitration. If parties\nare not agreeable for arbitration and conciliation, the court should,\nkeeping in view the preferences/options of parties, refer the matter\nto any one of the other three other ADR processes.
